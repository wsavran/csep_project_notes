## CSEP2 Roadmap
**Milestones**
1. [agu poster](#agu-poster) (due: 07 Dec 2018)
    * ucerf3 simulations in Landers sequence
    * ucerf3 simulations for other large eqs
    * implement n-test, m-test, s-test for stochastic event sets
2. [paper on testing stochastic event sets](#testing-stochastic-event-sets)
    * ucerf3 simulations in Landers sequence
    * ucerf3 simulations for other large eqs
    * implement n-test, m-test, s-test (others) for stochastic event sets
    * determine power of statistical tests
3. [paper on testability of earthquake forecasts that involve faults](#testability-of-earthquake-forecasts-on-faults)
    - run csep1 ETAS simulations in csep2 experiment
4. [release csep2 testing center distribution](#csep2-testing-center-release)
    * write docs for csep2 github
    * implement methods to run experiments (db, jobs to hpc, post-processing)

## Project Overview
### AGU Poster

Will contain the following sections:
* **Introduction to CSEP2**
* **Testing Stochastic Event Sets**
  * csep1 style tests on stochastic event sets (n-test, m-test, s-test)
  * explanation of tests
* **Retrospective experiment involving UCERF3 and UCERF3-NoFaults**
  * **simulations after big bear**
  * *simulations 1 mo after big bear*
  * ~simulations following landers [complete]~
  * monthly simulations following (at least 1 month possibly up to 1 year after)
  * figures:
    * **global mfd**
    * **n-test visualization** (needs annotated)
    * *spatial map of landers and big bear ruptures*
    * map of cell-averaged (median) forecast numbers
    * ~magnitude vs. time [complete]~
    * ~cumulative numbers [complete]~
